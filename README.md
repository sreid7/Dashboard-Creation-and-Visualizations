5. Add Filter date for "failed logon attempts" - IDs that match **4625** = Failed logon attempt on a Windows system. Field = event.code, Operator = is, and Value = 4625
6. Specify "Windows" as the Index pattern
7. For the visualization type, use a table.
8. Create a row. select a field = user.name.keyword, number of values = 1000, ranked by = count of records. (Displaay name = Username)
9. Add metrics, function = count, (The count of records will be the data, assuming that data will be preset). (Display name = # of logins)
10. Create another row as "host.hostname.keyword" (which represents the computer reporting the failed logon attempt.) (Display name = Event logged by)
11. Create another row for "logon type". Using the "winlog.logon.type.keyword", (Used to display the type of method used to logon - either network or service. (Display name = Logon Type)

13. To reopen dashboard, click the listed dashboard and then click on the gear - select edit lens to be taken to the full saved dashboard. 

    **Usernames can be excluded by specifying additional filters ex. field = user.name.keyword, operator = is not, value = "username to be excluded".**
    **Computer accounts can be excluded by specifying the following KQL query and clicking on the "Update" button.

      **SIEM Visualization Example 1: Failed Logon Attempts (All Users)**
      NOT user.name: *$ AND winlog.channel.keyword: Security
      The AND winlog.channel.keyword: Security part is to ensure that no unrelated logs are accounted for.

**UPDATED** (add multiple users in one script) ---
    NOT (user.name: "john.doe" OR user.name: "admin" OR user.name: "system") AND winlog.channel.keyword: Security

Ex. NOT user.name.keyword: ("WIN-OK9BH1BCKSD" OR "DESKTOP-DPOESND" OR "WIN-RMMGJA7T9TC") AND winlog.channel.keyword: "Security"
